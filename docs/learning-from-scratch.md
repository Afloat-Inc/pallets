# Learning blockchain from scratch (focused on devops)

Maybe it'll differ from Max's learning path.

- [x] Git/Github (cloning repos, issues, projects, avoid commits and code reviews for now)
- [x] Networking basic concepts (ports, firewall, p2p)
- [x] Linux Terminal, deployment and server ops (ssh, systemd, reverse proxy with nginx)
- [ ] Gcloud plattform & terminal
- [ ] Blockchain and crypto things in general (platzi courses(?) )
  - [ ] Brief history about blockchain
  - [ ] Blockchain as a concept, white papers, mining
  - [ ] 2.0 smart contracts (layers ?)
  - [ ] Concensus protocol basics
- [ ] Substrate fundamentals (up to intermediate level):
  - [ ] Polkadot concepts (include types of nodes?)
  - [ ] What is substrate & concepts (aura, grandpa, types of keys, pallets)
  - [ ] First tutorials? (only about deployment)
  - [ ] Polkadot explorer interface (focus on metrics and/or querys)
  - [ ] Our projects ( hosted on hashed chain ->(afloat, leasex, weed seeds), hypha, liberland-soil)
  - [ ] Chainspec
  - [ ] Hashed chain deployment (?)
  - [ ] Github CI (github actions)
  - [ ] Kusama
    - [ ] Validator node (How to, our deployment)
    - [ ] Tokenomics & Staking (If nominator: claim rewards)
  - [ ] Medium/long term:
    - [ ] Grafana
    - [ ] Runtime updates (focus on parameter configurations on the runtime? )
    - [ ] Propose bounties to the team on hashed chain
- [ ] On the long term:
  - [ ] Kubernetes
  - [ ] Akash
